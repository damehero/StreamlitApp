# StreamlitApp: STEM Career Project

[![made-with-python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Made%20with-Python-1f425f.svg)](https://www.python.org/)

* Created a [web application](https://stem-career-project.herokuapp.com/) to serve as an interactive and visual expansion on an assignment originally submitted as a final prjoect for COGS 108: Data Science in Practice, taught remotely by UC San Diego in Spring 2020.
* Webscraped over 1000 unique job postings from [Glassdoor.com](https://www.glassdoor.com/sitedirectory/title-jobs.htm) using Selenium and Chromedriver
* Feature engineered from the text of each job description to quantify the value companies place on skills such as Python, Java, AWS, Figma and many other skills.
* Optimized a Random Forest Regressor from scikit-learn to create a tool that estimates software engineering, data science, and product design salaries (MAE ~ $7K)
* Built and depolyed a web application for users to input parameters and receive a salary estimate, using Streamlit and Heroku.
 

## Code and Resources Used 
**Python Version:** 3.7  
**Packages:** pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn, altair, selenium, streamlit, pickle  
**For Replicating Libraries:**  ```pip install -r requirements.txt```  
**Scraper Github:** https://github.com/arapfaik/scraping-glassdoor-selenium  
**Scraper Article:** https://towardsdatascience.com/selenium-tutorial-scraping-glassdoor-com-in-10-minutes-3d0915c6d905  

## Web Scraping
Tweaked the web scraper github repo (above) to scrape 1000 job postings from glassdoor.com. With each job, we got the following:
*	Job title
*	Salary Estimate
*	Job Description
*	Rating
*	Company 
*	Location
*	Company Headquarters 
*	Company Size
*	Company Founded Date
*	Type of Ownership 
*	Industry
*	Sector
*	Revenue
*	Competitors 

## Data Cleaning
After scraping the data, I needed to clean it up so that it was usable for the model. I made the following changes and created the following variables:

*	Parsed numeric data out of salary 
*	Removed rows without salary 
*	Parsed rating out of company text 
*	Made a new column for company city and state 
*	Added a column for if the job was at the companyâ€™s headquarters 
*	Transformed founded date into age of company 
*	Made columns for if different skills were listed in the job description:
    * Python  
    * Java  
    * R  
    * AWS  
    * Excel 
*	Column for simplified job title and Seniority 

## Model Building & Performance

First, I transformed the categorical variables into dummy variables. I also split the data into train and tests sets with a test size of 20%.   

I tried three different models and evaluated them using Mean Absolute Error. MAE is an ideal metric of evaluation because it is relatively easy to interpret and there aren't any severe outliers in this model.   

The three different models:
*	**Multiple Linear Regression**
*	**Lasso Regression**
*	**Random Forest**

The Random Forest model was the best suited approach for the test and validation sets. 
*	**Random Forest** : MAE = 7.41

## Productionization 
In this step, I built a Streamlit web app to display the notebook with data visualizations, the salary predictor, and the results of the project. You can view it [here](https://stem-career-project.herokuapp.com/). If it goes down for whatever reason, here is what the interface looked like:
