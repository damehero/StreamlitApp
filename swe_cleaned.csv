Software Engineer - Server Applications,$48K-$102K (Glassdoor est.),"The Role:

Every day, Clover devices handle the core credit card and point-of-sale processing for hundreds of thousands of merchants. Behind the scenes, we operate a cloud platform providing processing, storage and collaboration for merchants, application developers, service providers and our merchants' customers. Our devices and platform form the backbone of millions of payment interactions between merchants and their customers daily.

To support all of this, we have a team of engineers dedicated to ensuring our systems remain operational, safe and secure. Our systems not only process payments, but help merchants run their businesses with inventory management solutions, customer loyalty rewards and other applications that are tailored to their industry. Right now, as we are looking to dive into new markets and expand our breadth of product, and we need server engineers to improve our applications in order to reach company goals.
At Clover, our team is broken down into product-focused squads. Each squad comes with its own unique set of responsibilities and contains engineers from all parts of the stack. These squads range from developer focused to business solution focused for our merchants. For instance, The Clover App Market currently boasts over 220 applications from 3rd party developers. We have a squad dedicated to supporting 3rd parties development on our platform and another squad supporting App Market functionality and ease of use for merchants. We also have squads supporting our core payments business which can generate over 5400 transactions a minute. One squad focuses on EMV, NFC, and swipe transactions, and another touches more on the reporting end, so merchants can gain valuable insights to the businesses.
Our Server Application Engineers are tasked with improving/expanding our platform and product. They work closely with the Infrastructure Team, Product Team, and Design Team. Our engineers are pragmatic in balancing priorities and enjoy working in an iterative model where application features and server improvements are released every other week and bug-fixes are deployed as needed.

We plan to further grow our semi-integrated partnerships, expand services to deal with multi-site and enterprise merchant management, and ramp existing services up for global expansion. We also hope to break our existing infrastructure down into digestible microservices to better support our merchants.
On a daily basis, you will spend 50% of your time developing new features, 30% of your time investigating/reproducing/resolving bugs, and about 20% of your time driving testing and creating helpful documentation. We are interested in hiring flexible engineers who are not afraid to be involved in product discussions and work with multiple parts of the stack.
Responsibilities:
Design and implement REST APIs for mobile and web clients including our payment devices, web dashboard, and 3rd party apps
Identify technical requirements in product meetings and assist the business team with realistic project planning and feature development; translate product requirements into functional, maintainable, extensible software that is in-line with company objectives
Own your merchant-facing services /features from development through deployment and production monitoring
Work with the Infrastructure Team to design data models to support large-scale highly available services
Work with QA to develop test plans/strategies

Essential Functions and Job Responsibilities:
Provide comprehensive operational and maintenance support to three MARFORRES web based application systems: 1) Memorandum Fiscal Services (MFS); 2) Training, Exercise and Employment Program (TEEP), Transportation of people, and transportation of things (T3); and MFR Manpower. Below is a brief description of each of the applications.

MFS is the primary MARFORES financial system used to integrate diverse data from external systems. MFS delivers a wide span of support covering multiple functional areas within the MARFORRES financial community such as the following: budgeting support, authorization funding management, conference request routing, unit travel card processing, transactional research/validation, financial reporting, billing reconciliation, Defense Travel System account management, and evaluation assessments. MFS is a web based system supporting more than 500 active users throughout the continental United States in support of the MARFORRES financial community. MFS is an ever-evolving financial tool designed to provide accurate and expedient budgeting and accounting information to assist managers in making informed decisions effecting the command’s financial posture. With Business Process Reengineering as the main focus of MFS, the system is designed to fill capability gaps, automate and streamline workflows, and provide integrated reporting capabilities. MFS is agile and able to adapt quickly to the changing DoD financial landscape as new requirements and policy changes must be incorporated into the system to ensure compliancy. MFS is a primary facilitating system for MARFORRES in audit support by offering document retention and rapid retrieval capabilities. MFS has three major external data feeds and two additional internal data exchanges which are processed daily from these Marine Corps systems: SMARTS, MROWS, and GCSS-MC. Currently there are 4 data exchanges, 3 are one-directional (incoming) and one interface is bi-directional. Once the data is received, MFS runs an integration processing job to prepare this data for end users every morning. On average annually, the MFS programming cycle includes 3-4 major projects (greater than two weeks design phase – 4 weeks in the development phase) and roughly 8 minor projects (under two weeks in duration). The new development requirements range from cosmetic modifications to major modular rewrites based on the prioritization of the MARFORRES MFS Configuration Control Board. In addition, there are several items that fall outside of the normal System Development Life Cycle that require support such as: COOP preparation, ADHOC reporting support, system/network troubleshooting, and tasks required to maintain the system’s Authority to Operate (ATO). The contractor should be familiar with T-SQL DB and ASP.NET Web Forms in VB to work within the MFS program.

T3 is a web based system designed to be a Commander’s TEEP management and transportation management tool, capable of identifying unit, personnel, equipment, and resources prior to the execution of training exercises or deployments COMMARFORRES is responsible for the training and the operational readiness of 39,000 Marine Reservists. MARFORRES G-3/5 is responsible for managing a financial database that integrates Operating Budgets with training and exercises, which result in resource utilization over time. Resources are defined as units and their associated personnel, equipment, and funding. The MARFORRES G-3/5 Department provides budgeting, accounting, execution and financial support services through the T3 Database to four Major Subordinate Commands (4th Marine Aircraft Wing, 4th Marine Division, 4th Marine Logistics Group, and the Force Headquarters Group) in addition to many major programs managed at the headquarter level. A major challenge facing the MARFORRES G-3/5 is the geographical dispersion of the more than 160 sites throughout the United States.

The MFR IRR Management Application is a web based system designed to maintain accurate and current personnel records on members of the Individual Ready Reserve Components, to include mailing address, physical condition, military qualifications, dependency status, civilian occupational skills, availability for service, and other information that is needed to determine strength levels of the Military Services. Below outlines the current operating environment for this task area:

Currently Microsoft Visual Studio is used to develop the code, and Azure DevOps server for version control, testing and release management capabilities. The development team in coordination with the Marine Forces Reserve Server/Network personnel to conduct the user acceptance testing, performance, and load testing of the applications. Release notes are published to the home page of each application. Currently there are no set monthly release scheduled for changes to production. In the current environment MFR follows an agile schema, sprints are anywhere from 2-6 weeks, and depends on the complexity of the project.

The demands on each application translate to a functionality backlog of 50-100 items varying in levels of complexity. Each program manager operates on a continuous agile development schedule producing new functionality at least once a month. Our software engineers receives roughly on average of 10 tickets per month; most are for minor bugs or cosmetic changes. Non “bug” tickets are required to be presented to each applications Configuration Control Board (CCB). Out of the 10 tickets, about 2-3 requests per week ranging from simple bug fixes or cosmetic adjustments; major rewrites range from about (1-2 per year). Each application must also be updated to meet current technology platform changes which equate to major re-writes every three years on average.

Description

If you want to be a part of something big, we invite you to join our team at Bridge Connector — where we are changing the way healthcare communicates and having a great time doing it. Bridge Connector is an integration platform as a service (iPaaS) company that delivers data-driven workflow automation. Because any sized healthcare organization should be able to automatically transfer data between disparate systems without the need for internal IT support.

Our Nashville office is housed in the Fifth Third Center downtown, adjacent to the historic “Arcade,” and comes complete with just about every perk you'd expect for a startup tech company: all the caffeine, snack bar goodies, proper hydration and ping pong tables you could ask for... with engaging all-company meetings and endless opportunities for creativity, collaboration and professional development. We strive to hit that magic balance between rapid growth — hiring some of the brightest minds in healthcare and tech — and continuing to build a culture of authenticity and transparency where all can contribute. We go all-out to make sure our team feels supported: unlimited PTO (that they're encouraged to really use!), paternity/maternity leave, volunteer opportunities, paid medical insurance, a 401K program, free downtown parking of course, plus relocation assistance and the ability to work remotely for many positions.

Makes other engineers better through code reviews, thorough documentation, technical guidance, pair programming, and mentoring or serving as a Technical Lead on a project.
Ability to pick up new technology quickly and adapt in a growth environment.
Deliver software on-time, in scope, and make accurate estimates.
Requirements
Demonstrable, progressive experience as an Software Engineer for five or more years.
Developing enterprise software. Specifically, extensive experience creating readable and testable code.

Why consider OPI, and why do people dig working here?
Variety of consulting; new technologies, projects, and people on a regular basis.
Stability; we’ve been around since 1996 and have a diverse mix of clients and technologies to keep us busy, very busy. And we keep a bench. If you’re not on a project, you’re writing software for our internal business functions or you’re learning new technologies. It’s in our benefit to make our consultants as marketable as possible. That’s good for your career.
No politics or management; we don’t get in the way. Why sit in meetings all day when you can code and be productive?
Awesome benefits; free healthcare for your entire family (yes, free), 24 days of PTO + 10 days of sick time, quarterly profit sharing bonuses, you get paid OT, company trips (to Mexico), 3 company lake cabins/homes, various quarterly company events, new Macbook Pro’s, free beer/soda, chips, candy, and so much more.
You work with the best. Do an Object Partners search on LinkedIn and see the types of talent we hire. You truly get to work with intelligent, passionate engineers that share the same goal of building great software the right way.
Low company overhead. It all means more money back into our consultants pockets (profit sharing) or company trips and events to share in the financial success.

Qualifications

Architecture and design of highly available/scalable backend services
JVM service frameworks such as Spring Boot, Grails, Vert.x and Ratpack
Automated testing with tools such as Spock, JUnit and Cucumber

Passion for software development. Someone that loves what they do, that aren’t just in it for a paycheck. Do you have dev projects going on at home at all times?
Aptitude for learning. New projects, new teams, new technologies means having to adjust and learn all the time. You might get thrown on a Spring or mobile project as well, so having the ability to jump in and get your feet wet without hesitation is important. If you don’t want to grow and learn, we’re not a fit.
Positive, can-do attitude. We can teach the technology, but we can’t teach how to approach client challenges with a positive, helpful demeanor. The best consultants aren’t the most technical (although that sure helps), it’s the consultant that will do whatever it takes to see a client be successful, no matter what they throw at you.",4.7,"Object Partners

You are probably right for this role if you have built things as long as you can remember. Maybe it was puzzles, it could have been old electronics, gaming computers or it could have been software; whatever it was you loved hacking and building your way towards learning.

In the professional world, you’ve always gravitated towards anything that involves data and/or logic. Big data, machine learning, AI - doesn’t really matter what you call it, you are fascinated by the data, how it is captured, architected, processed, analyzed and ultimately used to meet people’s needs. You’re very comfortable being the sole backend engineer on a small team and have no problem figuring out the architecture that balances the needs of this feature and the larger needs of the system. You love owning projects end to end and look at bugs with curiosity, not fear or annoyance. As far as companies are concerned, you’ve been on a team with less than 20 engineers and have had a glimpse of a larger organization and how they operate at scale. That glimpse was all you needed - you’re ready to get back to something where you can have more ownership (our engineering team is currently six).

-Frontend: React/Redux JavaScript web app(s);
-Backend: ~30 containerized Node.js microservices communicating synchronously via HTTP and asynchronously using Pub/Sub as a centralized messaging bus.
-Persistence: Postgres, Redis, GCS, BigQuery, etc. We focus on hiding persistence as a detail in our systems and optimize for managed services where possible to focus on business-facing value.
-Infrastructure: Single cloud environment in Google Cloud Platform. We use Kubernetes, Helm, and Terraform to write our infrastructure as code, and keep our release pipeline operating smoothly.

Ideal background
-4+ years (or equivalent) relevant experience building production-quality backends in node.js
-Extensive hands-on Node.js experience a major component and familiarity with the npm ecosystem
-Experience building scalable API-first backends
-Experience working on an engineering team of less than 20 people
-Experience working at a company that “worked”

Passion for software development. Someone that loves what they do, that aren’t just in it for a paycheck. Do you have dev projects going on at home at all times?
Aptitude for learning. New projects, new teams, new technologies means having to adjust and learn all the time.

Positive, can-do attitude. We can teach the technology, but we can’t teach how to approach client challenges with a positive, helpful demeanor.

Before the dawn of everything internet, insurance was intimate and personal. You walked down the street to chat with your broker, and the risk to your business, your livelihood, was covered with a handshake. Today things are different. The average insurance policy for a mom-and-pop store trades through a dozen different hands and traverses a maze of systems and processes. Few are accountable and fewer know the whole story.

This is just a taste of the type of big problem we want you to solve. We seek a software engineer to help drive a digital product team on a mission to bring a new type of interaction to a market once exclusively driven by in-person relationships.

As a member of a cross-functional team of engineers, data scientists, designers, and product managers, you’ll provide input and have your voice heard on key product decisions, and the tools and resources to build and ship ideas quickly. You’ll be a part of a startup-like environment in a company with thousands of existing customers.

Who you are


Like Git? Great. Have a favorite data store? Front-end framework? Way of working? Propose it! We believe that a collaborative technology team focused on outcomes is capable of making rational decisions based on system-risk, ramp-up time and ease-of-use. Utility trumps novelty..

Some signs you might be ready:
You’re comfortable with ambiguity and you accept the challenge of figuring it out. You’re more than a coder; you’re someone who knows how to deliver. You want to work with a cross-functional team to design a solution as well as implement it.
You put users first and actively seek user feedback. You build to learn. You understand the role of validation and its place in the product development process.
You're deeply familiar with at least one programming language and its ecosystem, and you're comfortable learning others.
You value repeatability and automation. Automated testing and infrastructure as code are a way of life.
You're comfortable reading and debugging code written by others, and you write your own code to allow others to do the same. To that end, you appreciate the value of common standards.
You can recognize common code smells, and you know how to address them. You understand design patterns and know when and how to apply them.
You view security as a first-class concern. You can recognize common application vulnerabilities, and you know how to remediate them.
You look forward to having your work reviewed...and reviewing the work of others.
What you’ll own
Proposing tool chains, standards and practices.
Write snappy code, from flexible JavaScript libraries to concise, reusable services.
Work with the latest open-source projects designed to scale.
Build components for products that create market-defining experiences.
Creatively figure out how to use customer data to inform decision-making.
Work with product managers, designers, and data scientists to translate research findings into features.
Tools We Use


While we don't expect you to be an expert in all of our tools, the ideal candidate will be familiar with most on day one. Over your first few months, you'll become comfortable working with nearly all of them.

Why Cisco

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world-changing? Be you, with us!",4.1,"Cisco Systems - Engineering - Software

More about Apptegy

Apptegys mission is to help school leaders share the story of every student. Amazing moments are happening in school districts, but those moments rarely become stories that reach the community. Our products empower school leaders and educators to share those stories and run better schools.

Our unique value is with our publishing platform, Thrillshare, that allows schools to update all of their online communication from one place. Schools can write a message once, and Thrillshare automatically updates their iPhone app, Android app, website, Twitter, Facebook, text messages, and voice calls.

What its like to work at Apptegy

Working at Apptegy is different. For many of our team members, working here is unlike anything theyve experienced. We have an entire floor to ourselves in the Simmons Building (the tallest in Arkansas), where we have a great time, and get to work with school districts and schools across the U.S.

Were not going about building a company the easy way. Scaling a rapidly growing startup is difficult, but we wouldnt have it any other way. If the challenge excites you as much as it does us, come learn more about what we're building and what it takes to be part of Apptegy: Thoughtfulness and High Performance.

Thoughtfulness

Internally, we look for chances to make each others days. Noticing someone needs a pick-me-up, remembering birthdays, and celebrating others success all help strengthen our internal bonds. Externally, we want to amaze people with how much we care about both the products we build and the services we provide that happens by noticing and acting on opportunities to value others.

High Performance

What we are trying to accomplish is hard. While thoughtfulness is central to how we engage others, a personal ethic of high performance is needed across the company for us to succeed. High performance is a major focus in every role across the company.

Why Cisco:


#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

Platform Engineer,$46K-$100K (Glassdoor est.),"Job Description

Why consider OPI, and why do people dig working here?
Variety of consulting; new technologies, projects, and people on a regular basis.
Stability; we’ve been around since 1996 and have a diverse mix of clients and technologies to keep us busy, very busy. And we keep a bench. If you’re not on a project, you’re writing software for our internal business functions or you’re learning new technologies. It’s in our benefit to make our consultants as marketable as possible. That’s good for your career.
No politics or management; we don’t get in the way. Why sit in meetings all day when you can code and be productive?
Awesome benefits; free healthcare for your entire family (yes, free), 24 days of PTO + 10 days of sick time, quarterly profit sharing bonuses, you get paid OT, company trips (to Mexico), 3 company lake cabins/homes, various quarterly company events, new Macbook Pro’s, free beer/soda, chips, candy, and so much more.
You work with the best. Do an Object Partners search on LinkedIn and see the types of talent we hire. You truly get to work with intelligent, passionate engineers that share the same goal of building great software the right way.
Low company overhead. It all means more money back into our consultants pockets (profit sharing) or company trips and events to share in the financial success.

Qualifications

DevOps tools, practices, and philosophiesCloud services such as AWS, Google Cloud Platform, Azure, and Heroku.
CI tools such as Jenkins, GitLab CI, Drone, and Artifactory.

Passion for software development. Someone that loves what they do, that aren’t just in it for a paycheck. Do you have dev projects going on at home at all times?
Aptitude for learning. New projects, new teams, new technologies means having to adjust and learn all the time. You might get thrown on a Spring or mobile project as well, so having the ability to jump in and get your feet wet without hesitation is important. If you don’t want to grow and learn, we’re not a fit.
Positive, can-do attitude. We can teach the technology, but we can’t teach how to approach client challenges with a positive, helpful demeanor.

There are a lot of security companies out there, but no one is doing what Kenna is doing: giving our customers the ability to measure their risk landscape and truly protect their environments from the ever-present threat of a breach.

Why Cisco:


#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!",4.1,"Cisco Systems - Engineering - Software

If you’re not on a project, you’re writing software for our internal business functions or you’re learning new technologies. It’s in our benefit to make our consultants as marketable as possible. That’s good for your career.
No politics or management; we don’t get in the way. Why sit in meetings all day when you can code and be productive?
Awesome benefits; free healthcare for your entire family (yes, free), 24 days of PTO + 10 days of sick time, quarterly profit sharing bonuses, you get paid OT, company trips (to Mexico), 3 company lake cabins/homes, various quarterly company events, new Macbook Pro’s, free beer/soda, chips, candy, and so much more.
You work with the best. Do an Object Partners search on LinkedIn and see the types of talent we hire. You truly get to work with intelligent, passionate engineers that share the same goal of building great software the right way.

That’s good for your career.
No politics or management; we don’t get in the way. Why sit in meetings all day when you can code and be productive?
Awesome benefits; free healthcare for your entire family (yes, free), 24 days of PTO + 10 days of sick time, quarterly profit sharing bonuses, you get paid OT, company trips (to Mexico), 3 company lake cabins/homes, various quarterly company events, new Macbook Pro’s, free beer/soda, chips, candy, and so much more.
You work with the best. Do an Object Partners search on LinkedIn and see the types of talent we hire. You truly get to work with intelligent, passionate engineers that share the same goal of building great software the right way.
Low company overhead. It all means more money back into our consultants pockets (profit sharing) or company trips and events to share in the financial success.

Aptitude for learning. New projects, new teams, new technologies means having to adjust and learn all the time. You might get thrown on a Spring or mobile project as well, so having the ability to jump in and get your feet wet without hesitation is important. If you don’t want to grow and learn, we’re not a fit.
Positive, can-do attitude. We can teach the technology, but we can’t teach how to approach client challenges with a positive, helpful demeanor.

Senior Software Engineer – Microservices,$80K-$103K (Glassdoor est.),"Job Description

Why consider OPI, and why do people dig working here?
Variety of consulting; new technologies, projects, and people on a regular basis.
Stability; we’ve been around since 1996 and have a diverse mix of clients and technologies to keep us busy, very busy. And we keep a bench. If you’re not on a project, you’re writing software for our internal business functions or you’re learning new technologies. It’s in our benefit to make our consultants as marketable as possible. That’s good for your career.
No politics or management; we don’t get in the way. Why sit in meetings all day when you can code and be productive?
Awesome benefits; free healthcare for your entire family (yes, free), 24 days of PTO + 10 days of sick time, quarterly profit sharing bonuses, you get paid OT, company trips (to Mexico), 3 company lake cabins/homes, various quarterly company events, new Macbook Pro’s, free beer/soda, chips, candy, and so much more.
You work with the best. Do an Object Partners search on LinkedIn and see the types of talent we hire. You truly get to work with intelligent, passionate engineers that share the same goal of building great software the right way.
Low company overhead. It all means more money back into our consultants pockets (profit sharing) or company trips and events to share in the financial success.

Qualifications

Architecture and design of highly available/scalable backend services.
JVM service frameworks such as Spring Boot.
Reactive libraries such as RxJava, Ratpack, Reactor, Akka and Vert.x.
Automated testing with tools such as Spock, JUnit, and Geb.
JVM languages such as Java, Groovy, Scala and Clojure.
Relational database technologies such as MySQL, Postgres and Oracle.
NoSQL technologies such as Cassandra, DynamoDb, MongoDB and ElasticSearch.

Experience with microservice metrics, monitoring and logging.

Cloud based systems such as AWS, Google Compute Engine, Heroku, DigitalOcean.
Passion for software development. Someone that loves what they do, that aren’t just in it for a paycheck. Do you have dev projects going on at home at all times?
Aptitude for learning. New projects, new teams, new technologies means having to adjust and learn all the time. You might get thrown on a Spring or mobile project as well, so having the ability to jump in and get your feet wet without hesitation is important. If you don’t want to grow and learn, we’re not a fit.
Positive, can-do attitude. We can teach the technology, but we can’t teach how to approach client challenges with a positive, helpful demeanor. The best consultants aren’t the most technical (although that sure helps), it’s the consultant that will do whatever it takes to see a client be successful, no matter what they throw at you.",4.7,"Object Partners

Senior Software Engineer – Microservices,$80K-$103K (Glassdoor est.),"Job Description

Why consider OPI, and why do people dig working here?
Variety of consulting; new technologies, projects, and people on a regular basis.
Stability; we’ve been around since 1996 and have a diverse mix of clients and technologies to keep us busy, very busy. And we keep a bench. If you’re not on a project, you’re writing software for our internal business functions or you’re learning new technologies. It’s in our benefit to make our consultants as marketable as possible. That’s good for your career.
No politics or management; we don’t get in the way. Why sit in meetings all day when you can code and be productive?
Awesome benefits; free healthcare for your entire family (yes, free), 24 days of PTO + 10 days of sick time, quarterly profit sharing bonuses, you get paid OT, company trips (to Mexico), 3 company lake cabins/homes, various quarterly company events, new Macbook Pro’s, free beer/soda, chips, candy, and so much more.
You work with the best. Do an Object Partners search on LinkedIn and see the types of talent we hire. You truly get to work with intelligent, passionate engineers that share the same goal of building great software the right way.
Low company overhead. It all means more money back into our consultants pockets (profit sharing) or company trips and events to share in the financial success.

Qualifications

Architecture and design of highly available/scalable backend services.
JVM service frameworks such as Spring Boot.
Reactive libraries such as RxJava, Ratpack, Reactor, Akka and Vert.x.
Automated testing with tools such as Spock, JUnit, and Geb.

Passion for software development. Someone that loves what they do, that aren’t just in it for a paycheck. Do you have dev projects going on at home at all times?
Aptitude for learning. New projects, new teams, new technologies means having to adjust and learn all the time. You might get thrown on a Spring or mobile project as well, so having the ability to jump in and get your feet wet without hesitation is important. If you don’t want to grow and learn, we’re not a fit.
Positive, can-do attitude. We can teach the technology, but we can’t teach how to approach client challenges with a positive, helpful demeanor. The best consultants aren’t the most technical (although that sure helps), it’s the consultant that will do whatever it takes to see a client be successful, no matter what they throw at you.",4.7,"Object Partners

Senior Software Engineer – Microservices,$80K-$103K (Glassdoor est.),"Job Description

Why consider OPI, and why do people dig working here?
Variety of consulting; new technologies, projects, and people on a regular basis.
Stability; we’ve been around since 1996 and have a diverse mix of clients and technologies to keep us busy, very busy. And we keep a bench. If you’re not on a project, you’re writing software for our internal business functions or you’re learning new technologies. It’s in our benefit to make our consultants as marketable as possible. That’s good for your career.
No politics or management; we don’t get in the way. Why sit in meetings all day when you can code and be productive?
Awesome benefits; free healthcare for your entire family (yes, free), 24 days of PTO + 10 days of sick time, quarterly profit sharing bonuses, you get paid OT, company trips (to Mexico), 3 company lake cabins/homes, various quarterly company events, new Macbook Pro’s, free beer/soda, chips, candy, and so much more.
You work with the best. Do an Object Partners search on LinkedIn and see the types of talent we hire. You truly get to work with intelligent, passionate engineers that share the same goal of building great software the right way.
Low company overhead. It all means more money back into our consultants pockets (profit sharing) or company trips and events to share in the financial success.

Qualifications

Architecture and design of highly available/scalable backend services.
JVM service frameworks such as Spring Boot.
Reactive libraries such as RxJava, Ratpack, Reactor, Akka and Vert.x.
Automated testing with tools such as Spock, JUnit, and Geb.

Passion for software development. Someone that loves what they do, that aren’t just in it for a paycheck. Do you have dev projects going on at home at all times?
Aptitude for learning. New projects, new teams, new technologies means having to adjust and learn all the time.

If you don’t want to grow and learn, we’re not a fit.
Positive, can-do attitude. We can teach the technology, but we can’t teach how to approach client challenges with a positive, helpful demeanor. The best consultants aren’t the most technical (although that sure helps), it’s the consultant that will do whatever it takes to see a client be successful, no matter what they throw at you.",4.7,"Object Partners

That’s good for your career.
No politics or management; we don’t get in the way. Why sit in meetings all day when you can code and be productive?
Awesome benefits; free healthcare for your entire family (yes, free), 24 days of PTO + 10 days of sick time, quarterly profit sharing bonuses, you get paid OT, company trips (to Mexico), 3 company lake cabins/homes, various quarterly company events, new Macbook Pro’s, free beer/soda, chips, candy, and so much more.
You work with the best. Do an Object Partners search on LinkedIn and see the types of talent we hire. You truly get to work with intelligent, passionate engineers that share the same goal of building great software the right way.

That’s good for your career.
No politics or management; we don’t get in the way. Why sit in meetings all day when you can code and be productive?
Awesome benefits; free healthcare for your entire family (yes, free), 24 days of PTO + 10 days of sick time, quarterly profit sharing bonuses, you get paid OT, company trips (to Mexico), 3 company lake cabins/homes, various quarterly company events, new Macbook Pro’s, free beer/soda, chips, candy, and so much more.
You work with the best. Do an Object Partners search on LinkedIn and see the types of talent we hire. You truly get to work with intelligent, passionate engineers that share the same goal of building great software the right way.

Aptitude for learning. New projects, new teams, new technologies means having to adjust and learn all the time. You might get thrown on a Spring or mobile project as well, so having the ability to jump in and get your feet wet without hesitation is important. If you don’t want to grow and learn, we’re not a fit.
Positive, can-do attitude. We can teach the technology, but we can’t teach how to approach client challenges with a positive, helpful demeanor.

Senior Software Engineer – Microservices,$80K-$103K (Glassdoor est.),"Job Description

Why consider OPI, and why do people dig working here?
Variety of consulting; new technologies, projects, and people on a regular basis.
Stability; we’ve been around since 1996 and have a diverse mix of clients and technologies to keep us busy, very busy. And we keep a bench. If you’re not on a project, you’re writing software for our internal business functions or you’re learning new technologies. It’s in our benefit to make our consultants as marketable as possible. That’s good for your career.
No politics or management; we don’t get in the way. Why sit in meetings all day when you can code and be productive?
Awesome benefits; free healthcare for your entire family (yes, free), 24 days of PTO + 10 days of sick time, quarterly profit sharing bonuses, you get paid OT, company trips (to Mexico), 3 company lake cabins/homes, various quarterly company events, new Macbook Pro’s, free beer/soda, chips, candy, and so much more.
You work with the best. Do an Object Partners search on LinkedIn and see the types of talent we hire. You truly get to work with intelligent, passionate engineers that share the same goal of building great software the right way.
Low company overhead. It all means more money back into our consultants pockets (profit sharing) or company trips and events to share in the financial success.

Qualifications

Architecture and design of highly available/scalable backend services.
JVM service frameworks such as Spring Boot.
Reactive libraries such as RxJava, Ratpack, Reactor, Akka and Vert.x.
Automated testing with tools such as Spock, JUnit, and Geb.
JVM languages such as Java, Groovy, Scala and Clojure.
Relational database technologies such as MySQL, Postgres and Oracle.
NoSQL technologies such as Cassandra, DynamoDb, MongoDB and ElasticSearch.

Experience with microservice metrics, monitoring and logging.

Cloud based systems such as AWS, Google Compute Engine, Heroku, DigitalOcean.
Passion for software development. Someone that loves what they do, that aren’t just in it for a paycheck. Do you have dev projects going on at home at all times?
Aptitude for learning. New projects, new teams, new technologies means having to adjust and learn all the time. You might get thrown on a Spring or mobile project as well, so having the ability to jump in and get your feet wet without hesitation is important. If you don’t want to grow and learn, we’re not a fit.
Positive, can-do attitude. We can teach the technology, but we can’t teach how to approach client challenges with a positive, helpful demeanor. The best consultants aren’t the most technical (although that sure helps), it’s the consultant that will do whatever it takes to see a client be successful, no matter what they throw at you.",4.7,"Object Partners

Senior Software Engineer – Microservices,$80K-$103K (Glassdoor est.),"Job Description

Why consider OPI, and why do people dig working here?
Variety of consulting; new technologies, projects, and people on a regular basis.
Stability; we’ve been around since 1996 and have a diverse mix of clients and technologies to keep us busy, very busy. And we keep a bench. If you’re not on a project, you’re writing software for our internal business functions or you’re learning new technologies. It’s in our benefit to make our consultants as marketable as possible. That’s good for your career.
No politics or management; we don’t get in the way. Why sit in meetings all day when you can code and be productive?
Awesome benefits; free healthcare for your entire family (yes, free), 24 days of PTO + 10 days of sick time, quarterly profit sharing bonuses, you get paid OT, company trips (to Mexico), 3 company lake cabins/homes, various quarterly company events, new Macbook Pro’s, free beer/soda, chips, candy, and so much more.
You work with the best. Do an Object Partners search on LinkedIn and see the types of talent we hire. You truly get to work with intelligent, passionate engineers that share the same goal of building great software the right way.
Low company overhead. It all means more money back into our consultants pockets (profit sharing) or company trips and events to share in the financial success.

Qualifications

Architecture and design of highly available/scalable backend services.
JVM service frameworks such as Spring Boot.
Reactive libraries such as RxJava, Ratpack, Reactor, Akka and Vert.x.
Automated testing with tools such as Spock, JUnit, and Geb.

Passion for software development. Someone that loves what they do, that aren’t just in it for a paycheck. Do you have dev projects going on at home at all times?
Aptitude for learning. New projects, new teams, new technologies means having to adjust and learn all the time. You might get thrown on a Spring or mobile project as well, so having the ability to jump in and get your feet wet without hesitation is important. If you don’t want to grow and learn, we’re not a fit.
Positive, can-do attitude. We can teach the technology, but we can’t teach how to approach client challenges with a positive, helpful demeanor. The best consultants aren’t the most technical (although that sure helps), it’s the consultant that will do whatever it takes to see a client be successful, no matter what they throw at you.",4.7,"Object Partners

Senior Software Engineer – Microservices,$80K-$103K (Glassdoor est.),"Job Description

Why consider OPI, and why do people dig working here?
Variety of consulting; new technologies, projects, and people on a regular basis.
Stability; we’ve been around since 1996 and have a diverse mix of clients and technologies to keep us busy, very busy. And we keep a bench. If you’re not on a project, you’re writing software for our internal business functions or you’re learning new technologies. It’s in our benefit to make our consultants as marketable as possible. That’s good for your career.
No politics or management; we don’t get in the way. Why sit in meetings all day when you can code and be productive?
Awesome benefits; free healthcare for your entire family (yes, free), 24 days of PTO + 10 days of sick time, quarterly profit sharing bonuses, you get paid OT, company trips (to Mexico), 3 company lake cabins/homes, various quarterly company events, new Macbook Pro’s, free beer/soda, chips, candy, and so much more.
You work with the best. Do an Object Partners search on LinkedIn and see the types of talent we hire. You truly get to work with intelligent, passionate engineers that share the same goal of building great software the right way.
Low company overhead. It all means more money back into our consultants pockets (profit sharing) or company trips and events to share in the financial success.

Qualifications

Architecture and design of highly available/scalable backend services.
JVM service frameworks such as Spring Boot.
Reactive libraries such as RxJava, Ratpack, Reactor, Akka and Vert.x.
Automated testing with tools such as Spock, JUnit, and Geb.

Passion for software development. Someone that loves what they do, that aren’t just in it for a paycheck. Do you have dev projects going on at home at all times?
Aptitude for learning. New projects, new teams, new technologies means having to adjust and learn all the time.

If you don’t want to grow and learn, we’re not a fit.
Positive, can-do attitude. We can teach the technology, but we can’t teach how to approach client challenges with a positive, helpful demeanor. The best consultants aren’t the most technical (although that sure helps), it’s the consultant that will do whatever it takes to see a client be successful, no matter what they throw at you.",4.7,"Object Partners

That’s good for your career.
No politics or management; we don’t get in the way. Why sit in meetings all day when you can code and be productive?
Awesome benefits; free healthcare for your entire family (yes, free), 24 days of PTO + 10 days of sick time, quarterly profit sharing bonuses, you get paid OT, company trips (to Mexico), 3 company lake cabins/homes, various quarterly company events, new Macbook Pro’s, free beer/soda, chips, candy, and so much more.
You work with the best. Do an Object Partners search on LinkedIn and see the types of talent we hire. You truly get to work with intelligent, passionate engineers that share the same goal of building great software the right way.

That’s good for your career.
No politics or management; we don’t get in the way. Why sit in meetings all day when you can code and be productive?
Awesome benefits; free healthcare for your entire family (yes, free), 24 days of PTO + 10 days of sick time, quarterly profit sharing bonuses, you get paid OT, company trips (to Mexico), 3 company lake cabins/homes, various quarterly company events, new Macbook Pro’s, free beer/soda, chips, candy, and so much more.
You work with the best. Do an Object Partners search on LinkedIn and see the types of talent we hire. You truly get to work with intelligent, passionate engineers that share the same goal of building great software the right way.

Aptitude for learning. New projects, new teams, new technologies means having to adjust and learn all the time. You might get thrown on a Spring or mobile project as well, so having the ability to jump in and get your feet wet without hesitation is important. If you don’t want to grow and learn, we’re not a fit.
Positive, can-do attitude. We can teach the technology, but we can’t teach how to approach client challenges with a positive, helpful demeanor.

Senior Software Engineer – Microservices,$80K-$103K (Glassdoor est.),"Job Description

Why consider OPI, and why do people dig working here?
Variety of consulting; new technologies, projects, and people on a regular basis.
Stability; we’ve been around since 1996 and have a diverse mix of clients and technologies to keep us busy, very busy. And we keep a bench. If you’re not on a project, you’re writing software for our internal business functions or you’re learning new technologies. It’s in our benefit to make our consultants as marketable as possible. That’s good for your career.
No politics or management; we don’t get in the way. Why sit in meetings all day when you can code and be productive?
Awesome benefits; free healthcare for your entire family (yes, free), 24 days of PTO + 10 days of sick time, quarterly profit sharing bonuses, you get paid OT, company trips (to Mexico), 3 company lake cabins/homes, various quarterly company events, new Macbook Pro’s, free beer/soda, chips, candy, and so much more.
You work with the best. Do an Object Partners search on LinkedIn and see the types of talent we hire. You truly get to work with intelligent, passionate engineers that share the same goal of building great software the right way.
Low company overhead. It all means more money back into our consultants pockets (profit sharing) or company trips and events to share in the financial success.

Qualifications

Architecture and design of highly available/scalable backend services.
JVM service frameworks such as Spring Boot.
Reactive libraries such as RxJava, Ratpack, Reactor, Akka and Vert.x.
Automated testing with tools such as Spock, JUnit, and Geb.
JVM languages such as Java, Groovy, Scala and Clojure.
Relational database technologies such as MySQL, Postgres and Oracle.
NoSQL technologies such as Cassandra, DynamoDb, MongoDB and ElasticSearch.

Experience with microservice metrics, monitoring and logging.

Cloud based systems such as AWS, Google Compute Engine, Heroku, DigitalOcean.
Passion for software development. Someone that loves what they do, that aren’t just in it for a paycheck. Do you have dev projects going on at home at all times?
Aptitude for learning. New projects, new teams, new technologies means having to adjust and learn all the time. You might get thrown on a Spring or mobile project as well, so having the ability to jump in and get your feet wet without hesitation is important. If you don’t want to grow and learn, we’re not a fit.
Positive, can-do attitude. We can teach the technology, but we can’t teach how to approach client challenges with a positive, helpful demeanor. The best consultants aren’t the most technical (although that sure helps), it’s the consultant that will do whatever it takes to see a client be successful, no matter what they throw at you.",4.7,"Object Partners

Senior Software Engineer – Microservices,$80K-$103K (Glassdoor est.),"Job Description

Why consider OPI, and why do people dig working here?
Variety of consulting; new technologies, projects, and people on a regular basis.
Stability; we’ve been around since 1996 and have a diverse mix of clients and technologies to keep us busy, very busy. And we keep a bench. If you’re not on a project, you’re writing software for our internal business functions or you’re learning new technologies. It’s in our benefit to make our consultants as marketable as possible. That’s good for your career.
No politics or management; we don’t get in the way. Why sit in meetings all day when you can code and be productive?
Awesome benefits; free healthcare for your entire family (yes, free), 24 days of PTO + 10 days of sick time, quarterly profit sharing bonuses, you get paid OT, company trips (to Mexico), 3 company lake cabins/homes, various quarterly company events, new Macbook Pro’s, free beer/soda, chips, candy, and so much more.
You work with the best. Do an Object Partners search on LinkedIn and see the types of talent we hire. You truly get to work with intelligent, passionate engineers that share the same goal of building great software the right way.
Low company overhead. It all means more money back into our consultants pockets (profit sharing) or company trips and events to share in the financial success.

Qualifications

Architecture and design of highly available/scalable backend services.
JVM service frameworks such as Spring Boot.
Reactive libraries such as RxJava, Ratpack, Reactor, Akka and Vert.x.
Automated testing with tools such as Spock, JUnit, and Geb.

Passion for software development. Someone that loves what they do, that aren’t just in it for a paycheck. Do you have dev projects going on at home at all times?
Aptitude for learning. New projects, new teams, new technologies means having to adjust and learn all the time. You might get thrown on a Spring or mobile project as well, so having the ability to jump in and get your feet wet without hesitation is important. If you don’t want to grow and learn, we’re not a fit.
Positive, can-do attitude. We can teach the technology, but we can’t teach how to approach client challenges with a positive, helpful demeanor. The best consultants aren’t the most technical (although that sure helps), it’s the consultant that will do whatever it takes to see a client be successful, no matter what they throw at you.",4.7,"Object Partners

Senior Software Engineer – Microservices,$80K-$103K (Glassdoor est.),"Job Description

Why consider OPI, and why do people dig working here?
Variety of consulting; new technologies, projects, and people on a regular basis.
Stability; we’ve been around since 1996 and have a diverse mix of clients and technologies to keep us busy, very busy. And we keep a bench. If you’re not on a project, you’re writing software for our internal business functions or you’re learning new technologies. It’s in our benefit to make our consultants as marketable as possible. That’s good for your career.
No politics or management; we don’t get in the way. Why sit in meetings all day when you can code and be productive?
Awesome benefits; free healthcare for your entire family (yes, free), 24 days of PTO + 10 days of sick time, quarterly profit sharing bonuses, you get paid OT, company trips (to Mexico), 3 company lake cabins/homes, various quarterly company events, new Macbook Pro’s, free beer/soda, chips, candy, and so much more.
You work with the best. Do an Object Partners search on LinkedIn and see the types of talent we hire. You truly get to work with intelligent, passionate engineers that share the same goal of building great software the right way.
Low company overhead. It all means more money back into our consultants pockets (profit sharing) or company trips and events to share in the financial success.

Qualifications

Architecture and design of highly available/scalable backend services.
JVM service frameworks such as Spring Boot.
Reactive libraries such as RxJava, Ratpack, Reactor, Akka and Vert.x.
Automated testing with tools such as Spock, JUnit, and Geb.

Passion for software development. Someone that loves what they do, that aren’t just in it for a paycheck. Do you have dev projects going on at home at all times?
Aptitude for learning. New projects, new teams, new technologies means having to adjust and learn all the time. You might get thrown on a Spring or mobile project as well, so having the ability to jump in and get your feet wet without hesitation is important. If you don’t want to grow and learn, we’re not a fit.
Positive, can-do attitude. We can teach the technology, but we can’t teach how to approach client challenges with a positive, helpful demeanor. The best consultants aren’t the most technical (although that sure helps), it’s the consultant that will do whatever it takes to see a client be successful, no matter what they throw at you.",4.7,"Object Partners

Senior Software Engineer – Microservices,$80K-$103K (Glassdoor est.),"Job Description

Why consider OPI, and why do people dig working here?
Variety of consulting; new technologies, projects, and people on a regular basis.
Stability; we’ve been around since 1996 and have a diverse mix of clients and technologies to keep us busy, very busy. And we keep a bench. If you’re not on a project, you’re writing software for our internal business functions or you’re learning new technologies. It’s in our benefit to make our consultants as marketable as possible. That’s good for your career.
No politics or management; we don’t get in the way. Why sit in meetings all day when you can code and be productive?
Awesome benefits; free healthcare for your entire family (yes, free), 24 days of PTO + 10 days of sick time, quarterly profit sharing bonuses, you get paid OT, company trips (to Mexico), 3 company lake cabins/homes, various quarterly company events, new Macbook Pro’s, free beer/soda, chips, candy, and so much more.
You work with the best. Do an Object Partners search on LinkedIn and see the types of talent we hire. You truly get to work with intelligent, passionate engineers that share the same goal of building great software the right way.
Low company overhead. It all means more money back into our consultants pockets (profit sharing) or company trips and events to share in the financial success.

Qualifications

Architecture and design of highly available/scalable backend services.
JVM service frameworks such as Spring Boot.
Reactive libraries such as RxJava, Ratpack, Reactor, Akka and Vert.x.
Automated testing with tools such as Spock, JUnit, and Geb.

Passion for software development. Someone that loves what they do, that aren’t just in it for a paycheck. Do you have dev projects going on at home at all times?
Aptitude for learning. New projects, new teams, new technologies means having to adjust and learn all the time.

If you don’t want to grow and learn, we’re not a fit.
Positive, can-do attitude. We can teach the technology, but we can’t teach how to approach client challenges with a positive, helpful demeanor. The best consultants aren’t the most technical (although that sure helps), it’s the consultant that will do whatever it takes to see a client be successful, no matter what they throw at you.",4.7,"Object Partners
