0,Product Designer,$129K-$153K (Glassdoor est.),"About Quora:


The vast majority of human knowledge is still not on the internet. Most of it is trapped in the form of experience in people's heads, or buried in books and papers that only experts can access. More than a billion people use the internet, yet only a tiny fraction contribute their knowledge to it. We want to democratize access to knowledge of all kinds from politics to painting, cooking to coding, etymology to experiences so if someone out there knows something, anyone else can learn it. Our mission is to share and grow the world's knowledge, and we're building a world-class team to help us achieve this mission.

About the Team:


We're creating a repository for all human knowledge. To do this, we need to design systems that make sharing knowledge rewarding and discovering it easy; and that scale to support the participation of the entire planet. Designing a global ecosystem for knowledge sharing, and the platform for businesses to reach this audience, requires a multidisciplinary approach. We're building a diverse team with people of different backgrounds and experiences, empowered to shape strategy while moving quickly and learning as much as possible.

Designers at Quora are building a system to democratize access to all knowledge for the entire world. Our work leverages what we learn about psychological and social dynamics, communities and networks, and systems and policy design, in addition to more typical design skills. We value a diverse team and pursue candor, holism, rigor, care, and awareness in our work.

About the Role:


Quora designers are thoughtful generalists. As a product designer, you'll be responsible for what you design from start to finish: brainstorming solutions, iterating on visuals and interactions however you see fit, and finally implementing your designs in code yourself (no middlemen required!). You work on everything from ranking to UI, from internationalization to moderation systems. Your design decisions are validated through A/B testing and user studies alike, as we value rigor and empathy in equal measure.

Responsibilities:
Work on a product team focused on a major, user-facing area of Quora. Identify high-impact opportunities, design features in pursuit of goals, and explain the rationale for your decisions
Collaborate with engineers to define features and functionality, with other designers for feedback and critique, and with data scientists and user researchers to evaluate the impact of your work
Design interactions for new features, applying existing design patterns and creating new ones, across our platforms
Build what you design using React
Work quickly and effectively on multiple projects. Ship new features, bug fixes, and small improvements multiple times a week
Minimum Qualifications:


A portfolio demonstrating relevant design capabilities is required. Applications without portfolios will not be reviewed
Technical competence with front-end technologies: React, HTML, CSS, JS
Ability to think at a high level about a complex, social product, and to clearly explain reasons for new features and changes
Experience building clear, effective interactions to accomplish product or business goals
Demonstrated visual design skill, especially in the construction of visual hierarchies, and attention to detail on typography, spacing, and color
Interest in using data and user research to inform design decisions. Experience with effective A/B testing is a plus
The number of years of professional experience you have isn't important to us
Preferred Qualifications:


Interest or experience in designing for ads, mobile, or user growth is a plus
Experience with effective A/B testing
Experience with server-side languages like Python
We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.

5,Art Director,$129K-$153K (Glassdoor est.),"We just keep growing. It’s amazing. Seriously. And if we had to boil our success down, it really comes down to great clients and remarkable people. Not good or solid. But truly remarkable people doing amazing things day after day, month after month, and year after year. It’s a tall order to find new people, because our kind of people tend to be really hard to find.
Are you ready to step out of the shadows?
We’re looking for a remarkable art director with 2-3 years experience. But, we know that sometimes remarkable comes in non-traditional packages. If you think you’ve got the stuff, don’t let “years of experience” stop you, read on.
So, what constitutes remarkable? We’re glad you asked.
Well, to start you can't be rude or an egomaniac.
You should hate, hate, hate boring. The last thing this world needs is another boring anything.
You’d be surprised but just those two mandatories disqualify so many possible candidates. We told you remarkable was hard to find.
Still reading? That’s a good sign.
We're not looking for just an art director; we're looking for a craftsperson. Someone who understands that a big part of success is thinking big, then rolling up your sleeves and getting dirty. And by ""dirty"" we mean: graphite, ink or even blood from a mean callous that split on your pointer finger from overusing a stylus pen or mouse.
Ok, so for those of you who just love a bulleted list here you go.
Responsibilities
Drive winning ideas forward.
Work closely with copywriters, ACD’s, CD’s to maintain an understanding of clients’ business challenges related to creative work and brand voice.
Work on design and layouts to develop and produce a strong, effective, and on-brief advertising campaign across multiple media platforms.
Concept creation and development, design direction, management and execution of overall visual language.
Work across teams regarding branding and visual hierarchy including interactive, pre- and post-production video, social and photography direction.
Interpret and apply brand identity standards effortlessly across all mediums.
Create and present creative concepts and design processes to clients, soliciting feedback and collaboration with clients and teams to ensure effective visual communications.
Qualifications
Exceptional portfolio that displays a strong understanding of design principles.
Experience in digital, video and print.
A work ethic that makes people wonder if you sleep at the office. (Not that you will we’ve got a really great work/life balance thing going on here).
The ability to take constructive critiques of your work by client and co-worker alike in stride.
Self-motivated to do incredible work.
You should love design and love to design. It should show in your work.
2 - 3 years of agency experience.
You should be brilliant at Photoshop. Not proficient, good or even great — brilliant. Same goes for Illustrator and InDesign. Actually, strike that. You should be amazing at finding and using whatever tools you need to make your ideas sing.
It would be great if After Effects and Premier were a little scared of you too. You haven’t beat them yet, but you’ve had some experience and are looking forward to dominating them as well.
You still here? We’ve got to be honest we’re impressed and excited that you might be one of the few. How to apply
If you want to become our new art director, here are a few simple steps you should take:
1. Look at our website. It outlines our philosophy, clients, work, etc. Do your homework. Then, if you get an interview, you can ask us smart questions.
2. Give us your resumé, website, glamour shot, or whatever your version of self-promotion looks like. Design it well, and again, don't be boring. Send it to jobs@paradowski.com with the header “Art Director”. Oh, and make sure the work you send is not the work you think we'll think is OK. Show us the work you love. Show us what makes you remarkable.",4.5,"Paradowski Creative

KWSM is a full service digital marketing agency made up of journalists. We specialize in website development & SEO, social media strategy & management, content creation, PR & influencer marketing, and digital advertising. Clients hire us to create integrated digital marketing strategies to generate leads or sales. Half our clients are B2B and half are B2C.

We have offices in Orange County, CA, San Diego, CA, Atlanta, GA and Las Vegas, NV.

Job Description

We are looking for a website designer/developer to create new websites, and refresh existing websites, for our clients. We are a digital marketing agency that believes that social media and digital ads work best when we can drive traffic to a highly-functional hub. There is no reason for a company to invest in a digital strategy if their website is outdated. You will work with our Content Editors to create an outstanding online presence for each of our clients, ensuring that their website and social media channels are working together.

We're looking for someone who truly wants to be part of our team. We're building something amazing, and need your ideas and talent to take our website program to the next level.

You will need to be familiar with Wordpress, Google web tools, and have a basic understanding of the major social media channels (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube). The ability to work on non-wordpress sites is also a plus. Throw in some graphic design skills, and we would be pretty excited about you.

We are looking for someone innovative and creative. We expect our web designers to have design capabilities in addition to the ability to simply build out a website. You must be able to listen to a client's goals and ideas, and create a website that exceeds their expectations.

We value efficiency and the ability to juggle several projects at once. At any given time, we are working with several clients simultaneously, and each one of them needs to be treated as a priority. You must be able to prioritize a to-do list and meet deadlines without fail.

This isn't the kind of gig where you can work through a couple of rounds of changes, and be finished with the site. We will continue to tweak a project until the client is thrilled. We're looking for someone who is loyal, patient, and cares deeply about giving clients exactly what they want and need.

The right designer/developer for our team will have a solid understanding of search engine optimization, how social media and websites work together, and best practices for online marketing. We design great looking sites - that work to boost our clients' visibility (and bottom line).

This is a full-time, salaried position with benefits and job security.

We operate on a 9/80 workweek - Fridays off every other week, 9-hour workdays from 7:00 am - 4:30 pm Monday - Thursday.

Qualifications

The right person for this job will be...

Creative.

If creating exceptional websites was easy, anyone could do it. If you have big ideas, are willing to take risks, and want a job where you can be innovative and try new things, KWSM could be a very good fit.

Communicative.

We tell stories for a living. That involves engaging and communicating with an audience online, but it also requires the ability to communicate well with our clients, and each other. We’re a small company, and you will have a lot of opportunity to add your feedback. We need someone who wants to be heard.

Great at Time Management.

Can you take a lengthy ‘to do’ list and prioritize what’s important? Can you multi-task when necessary, while continuing to perform well? Can you thrive in a bustling and interactive environment, and still get your work done? If so, you’ll fit right in!

Team-oriented.

We have a very collaborative office, and want to work with people who want to be part of a team. If you’re the kind of person who likes the door to their office closed, you probably won’t be happy here. (Our offices don’t actually have doors.)

Passionate.

We want to work with people who are passionate. If you have the ability to get excited about something and throw yourself into it, you will find a lot of kindred spirits here.

Why Join DISCO


We intend to build a multi-billion dollar business and think you should come along for the ride because:
We were the first movers to a cloud-based platform that has caused mass disruption within our market.
Our CEO is a true market visionary. He graduated with a computer science degree at the age of 15 and followed with a JD from Harvard Law School at the age of 19. His unparalleled insights into the fundamental issues in legal and the potential of technology and artificial intelligence to change our market at its core provide the guiding light for DISCO's long-term strategy.
We believe that product delivery professionals including product managers, product designers, and engineers differ from one another by at least a factor of 10. We believe that product delivery professionals including product managers, product designers and engineers differ from one another by at least a factor of 10. At DISCO, we only hire the top 1%. We pay them well and also include equity, which means , pay them well, and with equity, everyone has effectively been getting a raise each and every day. Given our product-focused mindset, product professionals are very much stars of the show. Given our product first mindset, product professionals are very much stars of the show. Our logo, the circle and square, represents the best lawyers and the best product professionals in the world.
We measure product delivery velocity by dollars of revenue per line of code, vs simply lines of code. We hire many more product managers and designers per engineer than most companies to drive a very thoughtful and deliberate product design and development process that ensures we are going to make money when we ship products. We hire many more product managers and designers per engineer than most companies to ensure that our engineers have a disambiguated product intent when they are building.
As a rule, we don't commit to external product delivery dates as we believe that unnecessarily constrains our creativity from both a product and technology point of view.
At DISCO respect isn't earned; it is assumed. Good humans inherently treat everyone respectfully. This is a very important concept at DISCO.
Given the high caliber of talent, the cutting-edge cloud-based technology stack, and thoughtful and novel product and design approach, you'll find yourself learning and growing at a rate you've not likely experienced in your career. Given that we only hire professionals that are passionate about their craft, you'll truly enjoy building a great software product and get in the best ""career shape"" of your life.
We use the ""2 Pizza Team"" organization design where small autonomous teams own a piece of a product or platform and ship software at rates comparable to a very lean and scrappy startup. We achieve consistency across these teams in the areas of design, product-wide use cases and technical concerns through a strategically focused set of overlay functions.
Finally, while we're an incredibly fast-growing organization, as a rule, we do not work crazy long hours. We believe in continuous product delivery, continuous product planning and design, continuous regular sleep schedules, continuous regular vacation, and continuous fun if you're passionate about your craft.

Organizational Overview

CSBS supports the leadership role of state banking supervisors in regulating approximately 5,400 state-chartered financial institutions and other financial services providers, including mortgage lenders. Established in 1902, CSBS is the nation’s leading advocate for the state banking system. In the wake of the financial crisis, our work in strengthening the hand of bank regulators and providing vital consumer protections is even more important.

The State Regulatory Registry, a Division of the Conference of State Bank Supervisors, supports a strong state mortgage origination and banking regulatory system to ensure legitimate lending practices, provide vital consumer protections, and instill confidence in both consumers and investors in the housing market. In 2003, long before the recent financial crisis, CSBS brought together an industry-wide coalition of state mortgage regulators, lenders, brokers, and technology companies to lay the groundwork for a uniform mortgage application and nationwide repository of licensed entities. In 2008 the passage of the SAFE Act required all state licensed MLOs to meet professional requirements including pre-licensure and continuing education, as well as pass a standardized test that is now one of the largest certification tests in the country.

Why Join DISCO


We intend to build a multi-billion dollar business and think you should come along for the ride because:
We were the first movers to a cloud-based platform that has caused mass disruption within our market.
Our CEO is a true market visionary. He graduated with a computer science degree at the age of 15 and followed with a JD from Harvard Law School at the age of 19. His unparalleled insights into the fundamental issues in legal and the potential of technology and artificial intelligence to change our market at its core provide the guiding light for DISCO's long-term strategy.
We believe that product delivery professionals including product managers, product designers, and engineers differ from one another by at least a factor of 10. We believe that product delivery professionals including product managers, product designers and engineers differ from one another by at least a factor of 10. At DISCO, we only hire the top 1%. We pay them well and also include equity, which means , pay them well, and with equity, everyone has effectively been getting a raise each and every day. Given our product-focused mindset, product professionals are very much stars of the show. Given our product first mindset, product professionals are very much stars of the show. Our logo, the circle and square, represents the best lawyers and the best product professionals in the world.
We measure product delivery velocity by dollars of revenue per line of code, vs simply lines of code. We hire many more product managers and designers per engineer than most companies to drive a very thoughtful and deliberate product design and development process that ensures we are going to make money when we ship products. We hire many more product managers and designers per engineer than most companies to ensure that our engineers have a disambiguated product intent when they are building.
As a rule, we don't commit to external product delivery dates as we believe that unnecessarily constrains our creativity from both a product and technology point of view.
At DISCO respect isn't earned; it is assumed. Good humans inherently treat everyone respectfully. This is a very important concept at DISCO.
Given the high caliber of talent, the cutting-edge cloud-based technology stack, and thoughtful and novel product and design approach, you'll find yourself learning and growing at a rate you've not likely experienced in your career. Given that we only hire professionals that are passionate about their craft, you'll truly enjoy building a great software product and get in the best ""career shape"" of your life.
We use the ""2 Pizza Team"" organization design where small autonomous teams own a piece of a product or platform and ship software at rates comparable to a very lean and scrappy startup. We achieve consistency across these teams in the areas of design, product-wide use cases and technical concerns through a strategically focused set of overlay functions.
Finally, while we're an incredibly fast-growing organization, as a rule, we do not work crazy long hours. We believe in continuous product delivery, continuous product planning and design, continuous regular sleep schedules, continuous regular vacation, and continuous fun if you're passionate about your craft.

This exciting opportunity will allow you to leverage your design skills to have real impact with our customers during designing and implementation phases. We place a high value on creative problem-solving, lifelong learning, and strategic thinking and will support you to continue to grow your established consulting and design skills so you can bring those skills to more of the world.

“The key is to set realistic customer expectations, and then not to just meet them, but to exceed them- preferably in unexpected and helpful ways” - Sir Richard Branson

Let’s dive into what that looks like day to day:

As a billable consulting resource (salaried, you’re not warming a bench at IC), you will be brought on for both discovery and delivery projects where we are delivering solutions in Salesforce Communities, Sales, and Service Cloud environments. You’ll partner with our service and values-driven consultants and developers and work on projects like:

- gathering requirements for customer engagements that result in mockups with the intent of providing a level of effort for full implementations, to be completed by the development team
- defining deliverables for customer projects with a focus on user experience to be included in Professional Service quotes
- defining, developing and explaining user personas and usage scenarios to customers to understand their goals and to gather feedback for new ideas and project refinements.
- performing Quality Assurance testing for customer engagements to ensure a focus on user experience

Plus, you’ll get to help the home team from time to time: with website design, product mockups and other design tasks in conjunction with our Sr. UX/UI designer.

Why you'll love this role:

You know design. You have a solid grasp of user-centered design (UCD), rapid prototyping, usability, and accessibility concerns. You’re in the business of doing it right the first time, knowing that you don’t always get a second. You don’t just have design skills, you know how to read requirements, dive into the why and take the idea and turn it into interactive, “tangible” deliverables.

You know Salesforce. You’ve participated in Salesforce Communities implementations, leveraging user stories and key usage scenarios and exceeding expectations that were already high. You stay current on updates in the ecosystem that impact user experience and design and can confidently assess when requests will require standard or customized components. Through internal and external opportunities we will help you continue to learn and grow

You want to see your work make an impact. Not just on experience, but on the idea that perfect service is possible, and attainable. Join us in our mission to empower the world to provide the perfect service experience, every time-through your design. Within the first year, your work will result in us reducing friction for both our customers and our internal teams as well as a reduction in design-based change orders.
Technology, Skills, and Certifications:
We are looking for someone very comfortable and competent with designing interface solutions and interactive mockups. A Salesforce Certified Community Cloud Consultant certification is definitely a plus but a strong eye for design is what is crucial.
You’ll need to be comfortable with the tools and languages of the trade: HTML, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (a plus), and AdobeXD to name a few. You should have a desire to grow your front-end coding skills along with your Salesforce knowledge.
Traditional design background with a degree? Great. Non-traditional path that led you here? Also great. We are looking to push limits, not impose them.
Benefits! We’ve got ‘em:

Rocket Insights (part of Dept) is looking for designers who want to build great products with great teams. Our philosophy is to hire smart, client-facing employees who can both build products right (design elegant user experiences) and also build the right product (understand and execute on our client's business goals).

About Us

Rocket Insights is a fast-growing, tight-knit group of experienced designers and engineers who love building products with like-minded folks. We have recently been acquired by Dept, an ambitious, high-flying agency who is going to build a worldwide brand.

We focus on building great products with clients that we enjoy and respect. Our work has improved people's lives, been seen by millions of users, featured in the app stores, had books written about it, featured in the press, received awards and, most importantly, brought delight to users.

We believe that:
Great UI/UX is critical; aesthetics, animation, simplicity, copy, and speed.
Software quality is a top priority; usability testing, design reviews, best practices.
Collaboration and great communication are the keys to any successful project.
Success comes from constantly learning/evolving peer reviews, conferences and practice.
A healthy work/life balance (aka getting home for dinner) is important.
What will your day be like?

At Rocket every day is different. People rarely get bored because things move fast and we work hard. Here are some of the activities that make up the day of Rocket designers:
UX Research - You'll do user and market research to understand target markets, direct and indirect competition.
Usability Testing - You'll test your designs with real people through usability testing to ensure that it really works for both our clients and their users.
UI Design - You'll design complex apps that are making a material impact on the world and will be seen by millions of users.
Prototyping
Design Sprinting
Member of Agile Team - You'll be a part of agile software development practices and peer/UI reviews.
Talking with Clients - You'll interface with clients. We estimate about 80% hands-on design and 20% client interaction.
Peer Review - Both learn new things from other Rocketeers as well as improve how we do things
About You
You have multiple years experience designing software user interfaces used by lots of people.
You have multiple years experience with design tools like Sketch, Invision, Figma, etc.
You're a natural problem-solver, a self-starter, and willing to take initiative.
You enjoy talking to clients and are good distilling technical information for a variety of roles within a business.
You have some business experience and understand multiple types of business models.
You have opinions about what makes a well-designed product
Are you a UI or UX Designer?

Another thing we believe is that designers don't distinguish between UI and UX. We expect our designers to execute on both the user interface level as well as the user experience level. They are inextricably linked. You don't focus on one over the other. If you've been focused on one your whole career you're likely not a fit for us. If you naturally find yourself doing both, talk to us!

Good Traits to Have
No ego - You realize design is about solving human and psychological problems, not solving artistic aspirations.
Business-minded - You understand that great design solves for the business as well as the user.
Articulate - You can communicate ideas clearly and succinctly.
Entrepreneurial - You like designing and building cool and new things.
Self-aware - You recognize your own strengths and weaknesses in real-time and can adjust accordingly.",5,"Rocket Insights

The Windsor Story:

From the beginning, Windsor has been owned and operated by generations of the Zekaria family. Their caring vision of shared beauty affects everything we do.

Why We Need This Position
As principal interaction designer, you will be a part of TEAGUE’s evolving legacy as we fuse the gap between the physical and the digital to help our clients bring innovative products and services to market. This means you are a designer with strong chops with GUI design but have experience working beyond the screen.

Your rich experience designing for people and technology will extend, challenge, and add new dimensions to TEAGUE’s established physical design prowess. As a principal interaction designer, you will have significant influence over what interaction design means at TEAGUE at how it will meet—or better yet, exceed—our clients’ objectives.
Who We’re Looking For
You are an experienced, dynamic, tech-savvy, solution-oriented designer that is constantly looking for challenges to broaden and deepen your skill set. When you wield tools, processes, and techniques, people pay attention due to your expertise. While you are always on the lookout for new, experimental techniques, you also know when to apply best practices for a fast, optimal result. You always have strong, clearly-articulated rationale for every design decision.
In this role, you would work alongside ACD/CD’s to steer the course of projects and guide clients. On any given day, you may find yourself producing wireframes and flows at appropriate fidelity; leading design reviews with clients; planning and executing design research; informally training TEAGUE designers on advanced interaction design skills; prescribing the right kind of design process for a project; producing advanced simulations to demonstrate flow or nuanced interactions and motion; presenting new tools and processes to the studio; and documenting detailed design for communication to team, clients, and developers.
Personality-wise, you are a proactive learner, eager to expand your skill set and cultivate capabilities with auxiliary skills related to your work. You are confident in your identity as a designer and general approach to design. You’re comfortable presenting to clients—even when it was interaction design work done by other members of your team. You are an established member of the design community, passionate about your industry, and keen to grow and share your skills.

Collaborate side by side with product and marketing managers as well as developers across the business to design high-quality digital products and user experiences.
Use creative research methods and available data to inform design decisions and evaluate the effective of the designs.
Design high-quality, thoughtful interfaces that balance aesthetics and usability.

273,Interaction Designer,$28K-$54K (Glassdoor est.),"TEAGUE combines technology expertise with design and a deep understanding of human behavior to deliver what’s next for our clients. The Global Design Studio (GDS) is a tight group of designers and technologists within TEAGUE’s Seattle-based HQ. We work with Fortune 500 companies, exciting startups, and everything in between to identify and realize physical and digital products and services. Our job is to push boundaries every single day.
The Interaction Designer role demands a passion for untangling complexity, identifying requirements, and designing information systems and user interfaces. This role should have a strong interest in user research, prototyping, storytelling, product strategy, and visual design.
Why We Need This Position
TEAGUE lives by the quality of our designers. Without smart, dedicated, and imaginative, creators, we’re simply not able to deliver on the wide array of spaces in which we work.
Who We’re Looking For
You are a designer looking to hone your craft by experimenting with design methods in wildly different contexts from one project to the next. You are endlessly curious about people and technology, and it’s a little scary how quickly you pick up on new ideas. Your approach to interaction design is resilient and faceted, because you understand digital screens are only one of the ways people interact with the world.
You know user research, stakeholder workshops, and your designerly intuition is how meaningful products and services are identified and reborn. You are adept at connecting the dots from research and can simultaneously entertain multiple, different potential solutions and schema. You also know when it is time to make decisions and start doing.
You believe in the power of iteration, critique, and collaboration. When faced with ambiguity, you rapidly sketch a breadth of potential solutions as a sense-making activity. You understand that communicating design—and its rationale—is just as important as the design itself, so you are building a tool belt of different techniques for visualizing potential solutions: sketching, wire-framing, storyboarding, prototyping, coding, motion graphics, data visualization, and so on.
What We Just Said, Now in 5 Bullet Points (a.k.a. Essential Qualifications)
Experience: Bachelor’s degree in a design-related major or professional experience equivalent; Master’s degree a plus; 1+ years of professional experience, including experience designing user interfaces for information products and services
Skills: Design visualization (e.g., Sketch, Illustrator, Photoshop, etc.) skills required; GUI simulation tools (e.g., Principle, Axure, InVision, etc.) required. Presentation tools (e.g., Keynote) required. Writing skills required. Video and motion tools (e.g., Premiere, AfterEffects) a plus; Programming and coding skills (e.g., HTML/CSS/JS) a plus.
Passion: Build a new and better world through expert design
Role: Wield interaction design skills to identify and realize new products and services
Personality: Driven, creative, collaborative, disciplined, self-motivated

Advances in digitalization, data and advance analytics are changing industries at pace with the pharma industry showing signs of movement

The Digital Health Market will grow exponentially over the next 3 years, with new applications in digital showing in phase 3 studies significant benefits for patients including overall survival in Cancer

AstraZeneca would like to leap frog in this area and has prioritized digital in R&D as a critical strategic area of focus by 2025, as part of the overall company strategy.

Digital Health R&Ds ambition is to transform healthcare, powered by digital, science and collaborations,
to deliver the healthcare outcomes and experience that patients care about the most.

The Digital Health R&D journey incorporates 3 key stages:
Stage 1 foundational, reimagine how we work, by maximizing the use of digital, data and analytics transform processes within R&D to gain significant benefits on speed of the portfolio (goal 9 months acceleration) productivity (goal -20% reduction in cost per patient per year) quality at source, patient experience and probability of success.
Stage 2 advanced, redefine clinical trials and digital health to improve overall patient experiences and outcomes, example redefining patient populations, remote clinical trials, patient apps to reduce/manage adverse events and improve patient outcomes (OS), using data from EHMr and RWE instead of control arms, and through PROs and continuous patient monitoring, creating new end points enabling studies in earlier stages of disease (ctDNA changes) prolonging significantly patients lives
Stage 3 future-readiness, reimagine healthcare, examples, AZ as a healthcare provider beyond medicines for certain indications (example: Breast Cancer, proving monitoring, predictive analytics and therapies for improved outcomes), full integration of Multiomics (imaging, genomics, proteomics ) to better predict and significantly improve patients health

You love designing with data, uncovering creative opportunities, and are capable of focusing on the smallest detail and levelling up to the 30,000-foot view. Its key that you know how its all connected. Its one thing to make new designs, its another to solve complex business problems tied to existing technology and systems. Here at AZ, we build solutions, not just screens and we share and keep feedback early and often. We help teams think about divergent possibilities and learn not to fall in love with our first ideas.

Ideally, this person would be located in one of our core locations: Cambridge, UK. Gothenburg, Sweden. Gaithersburg, MD. New York, NY. We will consider candidates in other locations, but we highly prefer the person to be in one of those locations.

WHAT YOU’RE GOOD AT:
Design thinking - You’ve probably been a product designer, or you’ve worked extensively in UI, UX, and IX and are excited to put those chops to work on building the best healthcare experience available.
Product passion - From wireframes and mood boards to mobile feedback visuals and pixels in clinic exam rooms, you care about installing what you design into our users’ healthcare experiences.

Entrepreneurship - You’re a self-starter who loves to own things end-to-end. You don’t ask for permission - you’re too busy making things happen.
Building good teams - Not managing them, building them. You know how to make those around you better and feed off their energy. You take care of your teammates.
WHY JOIN FORWARD?

We don’t want to just move dollars around the healthcare industry - we want to rebuild it and fix it. All of it. You’d be a major part of the story behind one of the most ambitious startup attempts of the past decade and you’d work with a team of people who want to use their talents for good.

Rocket Insights (part of Dept) is looking for designers who want to build great products with great teams. Our philosophy is to hire smart, client-facing employees who can both build products right (design elegant user experiences) and also build the right product (understand and execute on our client's business goals).

About Us

Rocket Insights is a fast-growing, tight-knit group of experienced designers and engineers who love building products with like-minded folks. We have recently been acquired by Dept, an ambitious, high-flying agency who is going to build a worldwide brand.

We focus on building great products with clients that we enjoy and respect. Our work has improved people's lives, been seen by millions of users, featured in the app stores, had books written about it, featured in the press, received awards and, most importantly, brought delight to users.

We believe that:
Great UI/UX is critical; aesthetics, animation, simplicity, copy, and speed.
Software quality is a top priority; usability testing, design reviews, best practices.
Collaboration and great communication are the keys to any successful project.
Success comes from constantly learning/evolving peer reviews, conferences and practice.
A healthy work/life balance (aka getting home for dinner) is important.
What will your day be like?

At Rocket every day is different. People rarely get bored because things move fast and we work hard. Here are some of the activities that make up the day of Rocket designers:
UX Research - You'll do user and market research to understand target markets, direct and indirect competition.
Usability Testing - You'll test your designs with real people through usability testing to ensure that it really works for both our clients and their users.
UI Design - You'll design complex apps that are making a material impact on the world and will be seen by millions of users.
Prototyping
Design Sprinting
Member of Agile Team - You'll be a part of agile software development practices and peer/UI reviews.
Talking with Clients - You'll interface with clients. We estimate about 80% hands-on design and 20% client interaction.
Peer Review - Both learn new things from other Rocketeers as well as improve how we do things
About You
You have multiple years experience designing software user interfaces used by lots of people.
You have multiple years experience with design tools like Sketch, Invision, Figma, etc.

You enjoy talking to clients and are good distilling technical information for a variety of roles within a business.
You have some business experience and understand multiple types of business models.
You have opinions about what makes a well-designed product
Are you a UI or UX Designer?

Another thing we believe is that designers don't distinguish between UI and UX. We expect our designers to execute on both the user interface level as well as the user experience level. They are inextricably linked. You don't focus on one over the other. If you've been focused on one your whole career you're likely not a fit for us. If you naturally find yourself doing both, talk to us!

Good Traits to Have
No ego - You realize design is about solving human and psychological problems, not solving artistic aspirations.
Business-minded - You understand that great design solves for the business as well as the user.
Articulate - You can communicate ideas clearly and succinctly.
Entrepreneurial - You like designing and building cool and new things.

Make marketing materials from scratch. Design, write, and produce landing pages, email campaigns, social media assets, sales collateral, published content, and more, end-to-end.
Tell stories. Notion is a product that can be simple or complex. It can also be used for many things. Create materials that help people understand the product and its value for them.
Constantly learn from our users to determine how they want to use Notion, how to teach them to do more with the product, and how to engage new users.
Measure how marketing materials are performing, and figure out how to make changes to increase engagement and conversions.

Intro

Why this Role?

1. Make an enormous impact on the company: Notion is growing rapidly through word of mouth, but we have the chance to go bigger. Creating compelling content — websites, videos, graphics, emails, etc. — is what will make this difference.

So, what will you do as a designer on the marketing team?
Make marketing materials from scratch. Design, write, and produce landing pages, email campaigns, social media assets, sales collateral, published content, and more, end-to-end.
Tell stories. Notion is a product that can be simple or complex. It can also be used for many things. Create materials that help people understand the product and its value for them.
Constantly learn from our users to determine how they want to use Notion, how to teach them to do more with the product, and how to engage new users.
Measure how marketing materials are performing, and figure out how to make changes to increase engagement and conversions.
You might be a good fit if...
You have at least 3-5 years of visual design experience, ideally producing marketing assets.
You're a masterful communicator, able to draw people in and enhance understanding through design and written language.
You can produce graphics, videos, and GIFs with a high level of craft and attention to detail.
You're a strong writer with a bit of edge and play in your voice.
Bonus: Coding abilities so you can build what you design. An understanding of how things work behind the scenes goes a long way.",5,"Notion Labs

Make marketing materials from scratch. Design, write, and produce landing pages, email campaigns, social media assets, sales collateral, published content, and more, end-to-end.
Tell stories. Notion is a product that can be simple or complex. It can also be used for many things. Create materials that help people understand the product and its value for them.
Constantly learn from our users to determine how they want to use Notion, how to teach them to do more with the product, and how to engage new users.
Measure how marketing materials are performing, and figure out how to make changes to increase engagement and conversions.
